# Configure MicroProfile with Azure Key Vault

This repo contains the code referenced in the tutorial '[Configure MicroProfile with Azure Key Vault
](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/microprofile/configure-microprofile-with-keyvault)' hosted on the [Azure for Java developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/) documentation site. This tutorial demonstrates how to configure a [MicroProfile](http://microprofile.io) application to retrieve secrets from [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) using the [MicroProfile Config APIs](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config) to create a direct connection to Azure Key Vault. By using the MicroProfile Config APIs, developers benefit from a standard API for retrieving and injecting configuration data into their microservices.

To learn more about how Microsoft enables developers to use MicroProfile on Azure, check out the [Eclipse MicroProfile on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/microprofile/) section on the Microsoft Docs website.
